# Weather-Station 🌦️
Welcome, this is my first step into the IoT world: a weather station made with ESP32.
This is a project that will teach me how to:
- Read real-world data from analog sensors
- Visualize the data via a web interface
- Build and store the data in a database
- Train an AI to predict weather

## 🛠️ Phases

### Let's start with the basics
For prototyping i'm gonna use:
- **ESP32**
- **Temperature sensor** (Current candidates: **DHT22** & **BME280)
- **Humidity sensor** (Current candidates:)
- **Pressure sensor** (Current candidates:)
- **UV sensor** (Current candidates: **VEML6075**)
- **Light sensor** to track day-night cycles (Current candidates:)
- **Breadboard**, jumper wires, resistors, LEDs
- **Power supply** (9V battery, USB cable or solar)
- **Housing for the device** (unless you like surprises)

> *Some sensors will be able to measure more than 1 value, such as **BME280**. These will help to get more accurate measurements by getting average readings.*

### Chapter 2 - 💻 Coding the Brain
<Some exquisite software>

### Chapter 3 - 🚀 Deployment and Fixing the Broken
<Some photos with errors>
<Some wrong schematics>
<Some correct schematics>

### Chapter 4 - 🧮 Structuring the Data
<Learn how to use MQTT>

### Chapter 5 - 🌐 Going Online
<Deploy a webserver using Python (Flask), HTML, CSS (No frameworks, pure bred stuff)>
<Set up a database>

### Chapter 6 - 🧠 Teaching the Rocks
<Train an AI>

## 🤔 Why This Project?
This isn't just about reading temperature. This is about understanding the **entire IoT pipeline**:
1. Hardware integration
2. Embedded programming
3. Networking protocols (MQTT, HTTP)
4. Backend + web development
5. Data engineering
6. Machine learning

I’ll document the mistakes and wins along the way. Hopefully, by the end, I’ll have something useful *and* a badass portfolio project.
