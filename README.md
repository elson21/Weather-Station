## 🤔 Why This Project?
This is **not** a YouTube project (yet). This is my personal journey to:
- Understand IoT from hardware to cloud
- Build something tangible and useful
- Learn by doing, not by watching tutorials
- Create a portfolio piece that showcases breadth and depth

I'll document mistakes, dead ends, and breakthroughs. If it turns into something worth sharing, maybe it becomes content later.

## 📸 Progress Log
Photos, schematics, and test results will go here as I build.

## 💬 Notes to Self

- Don't rush Phase 1. Get the prototype rock-solid before moving on.  
- Learn to read datasheets properly (especially for passive components).  
- Keep the codebase modular—drivers should be reusable.  
- Budget for at least 2-3 PCB iterations (you will screw up).  
- Security isn't optional—bake it in from the start.
